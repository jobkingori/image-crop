# Android Image Picker Demo
A sample app to demostrate Image Picker and Crop functionality in Android. I have used a gist from https://gist.github.com/TiagoGouvea/4739629db5f55d18cd72#file-pickimagehelper-java for getting consolidated image picker intent chooser and https://github.com/ArthurHub/Android-Image-Cropper library for doing image crop.
